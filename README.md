# Xenforo-Bumper
A generalized bumper for the Xenforo Forum platform. It works on the majority of xenforo-powered forums as they share near-identical structures.
This project uses the [DearPyGUI Library](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) to create a simple but easy to use UI and interacting with forums is done by using the [Selenium Library](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium).
